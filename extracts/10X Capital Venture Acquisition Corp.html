our Business Combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our Business Combination or
because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our Business Combination,
in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such Business Combination. Subject to compliance
with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our Business Combination.
If we are unable to complete our Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced
to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account. In addition, following our Business Combination, if cash on hand is insufficient,
we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations.</FONT></P>

preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses
during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical
accounting policies:</FONT></P>

account for our Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification
(&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 480 &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&rdquo; Shares of Class A common stock subject to
mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock
(including common stock that feature redemption rights that is either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption
upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times,
common stock is classified as stockholders&rsquo; equity. Our Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are
considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, shares of Class&nbsp;A
common stock subject to possible redemption are presented as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders&rsquo; equity section
of our balance sheet.</FONT></P>

apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. Net income per common share, basic and diluted for Class&nbsp;A
redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the interest income earned on the Trust Account, net of applicable franchise
and income taxes, by the weighted average number of Class&nbsp;A redeemable common stock outstanding for the period. Net loss
per common share, basic and diluted for Class&nbsp;B non-redeemable common stock is calculated by dividing the net income, less
income attributable to Class&nbsp;A redeemable common stock, by the weighted average number of Class&nbsp;B non-redeemable common
stock outstanding for the period presented.</FONT></P>
